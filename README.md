# PWC Data Analytics

This projecy used the dataset on **Forge - PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation** to perform data analysis using **Power BI**.

Three areas are included:
1. **[Customer Retention and Churn]**(#Task-1-Customer-Retention-and-Churn-Dashboard)
2. **[Call Center Solution]**(#Task-2-Call-Center-Solution)
3. **[Employee Diversity & Inclusive for HR]**(#Task-3-Employment-Diversity-Inclusion)

Key takeaway from this projects are:
- Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
- Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
- Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
- Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.


# Task 1: Customer Retention and Churn Dashboard
This task aims to create a comprehensive dashboard focused on customer retention for a telecom company. The dashboard will aim to provide actionable insights in a user-friendly format, enabling effective decision-making and strategic planning to enhance customer retention efforts.

I have gathered some insights and recommendations that I would like to share with:

**Service Insights:**

- Customers using the "Fiber Optic" internet service have a higher churn rate than those using "DSL."
- Customers who subscribe to the multiple line service churn more than those who do not.
- Customers who do not use streaming TV, online backup, and streaming movies churn more than those who do.

**Account Insights:**

- Customers who have issued technical tickets are more likely to churn.
- On average, customers who churn pay more.
- Customers with Month-to-Month contracts are more likely to churn.

**Demographic Insights:**

- Customers with partners churn more than those without.
- Gender does not seem to affect the churn rate.

## Recommendations to Improve Churn Rate:

- Promote the services of streaming TV, online backup, and streaming movies more, as these factors retain more customers.
- Enhance the customer experience for Fiber Optic and multiple line services.
- Analyze the reasons behind technical tickets and prevent them from happening, as this significantly influences customer churn rate.
- Encourage more customers to commit to long-term contracts instead of Month-to-Month contracts.

# Task 2: Call Center Solution

The task is to design a Power BI dashboard for PhoneNow's Call Centre Manager to provide a clear visualization of critical KPIs like customer satisfaction, call volume, and agent performance, aiming to facilitate data-driven discussions with management.

I have gathered some insights and recommendations that I would like to share with:

- **Average Satisfaction Below Target:** The current average satisfaction rate is 3.40, which is significantly below the target of 4.5. This indicates customers are not as satisfied with the service as desired.
- **Resolution and Answer Rates:** The percentage of calls answered is high at 81.08%, while the resolution rate is at 72.92%. Although the answer rate is satisfactory, there is room for improvement in resolving issues on the first call.
- **Average Speed of Answer:** The average speed of answer is 67.52 seconds, which may be contributing to lower customer satisfaction. Faster response times could potentially improve satisfaction ratings.
- **Agent Performance Variance:** There is a slight variance in agent performance metrics. While all agents are answering a similar number of calls, their average satisfaction rates and average speed of answer differ.

## Recommendation:

- **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Investigate the causes of low satisfaction by gathering more detailed feedback from customers. Train agents based on this feedback to improve communication and problem-solving skills.
- **Enhance Resolution Rates:** Aim to increase the first call resolution rate by providing agents with additional resources or authority to resolve issues promptly.
- **Follow-up on Unresolved Calls:** Implement a system to follow up with customers who had their calls answered but not resolved, ensuring their issues are addressed.
  

# Task 3: Employment Diversity & Inclusion

PwC Switzerland has been tasked to assist a telecom client in advancing gender balance within their executive management. Despite efforts, progress is stagnant, prompting a need for our expertise in diversity and inclusion, which we regard as essential for business success and innovation. The goal is to transform the inclusive culture into tangible results, addressing the practical hurdles to truly harness the benefits of a diverse workforce.

While there is a fair representation of women at lower job levels, there is a significant disparity at the higher echelons of the organization, especially at the executive level. In the "New Hire for 2020 by Gender" section, women constitute only 25% at the executive level, which indicates that hiring practices might not be adequately addressing gender balance at the upper levels of the organization.

In the "Promotion for 2020 by Gender" section, there is a visible trend where the percentage of women decreases as the job level increases, with a particularly steep drop at the Manager level. This suggests that there may be barriers to the advancement of women beyond certain managerial positions.

## Root causes for the slow progress in gender balance might include:

- **Unconscious Bias:** There could be inherent biases in the hiring or promotion processes that favor male candidates.
- **Pipeline Issues:** The number of qualified female candidates at higher levels might be low, possibly due to attrition rates or a lack of development opportunities.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Executive roles might not be as appealing to women who seek a better work-life balance, due to the demanding nature of such positions.
- **Retention:** Women in higher positions may be leaving the company at a higher rate than their male counterparts, potentially due to a lack of support or perceived inequity.
- **Promotional Criteria:** The criteria used to evaluate eligibility for promotions might not be equitable or could indirectly favor male candidates due to the types of achievements or characteristics that are valued.
