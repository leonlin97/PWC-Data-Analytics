 I have gathered some insights and recommendations that I would like to share with you.

Service Insights:

Customers using the "Fiber Optic" internet service have a higher churn rate than those using "DSL."
Customers who subscribe to the multiple line service churn more than those who do not.
Customers who do not use streaming TV, online backup, and streaming movies churn more than those who do.
Account Insights:

Customers who have issued technical tickets are more likely to churn.
On average, customers who churn pay more.
Customers with Month-to-Month contracts are more likely to churn.
Demographic Insights:

Customers with partners churn more than those without.
Gender does not seem to affect the churn rate.
Recommendations to Improve Churn Rate:

Promote the services of streaming TV, online backup, and streaming movies more, as these factors retain more customers.
Enhance the customer experience for Fiber Optic and multiple line services.
Analyze the reasons behind technical tickets and prevent them from happening, as this significantly influences customer churn rate.
Encourage more customers to commit to long-term contracts instead of Month-to-Month contracts.
